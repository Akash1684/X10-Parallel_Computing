# X10-Parallel_Computing
X10 is the PGAS (Partitioned Global Address Space) languages. It is a modern objectoriented programming language that introduces new 
constructs that significantly simplify scale out programming. The fundamental goal of X10 is to enable scalable, highperformance, high-
productivity transformational programming for high-end computers for traditional numerical computation workloads (such as weather 
simulation, moleculardynamics, particle transport problems etc) as well as commercial server workloads,such as big data analytics.
